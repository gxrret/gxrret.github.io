				<h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN<h2>
				<h3>Belkin International | September 2017-Present</h3>
				<p>
				As an intern for Belkin, I am currently working with the WeMo team on building a suite of UI tests for the WeMo iOS app. WeMo is Belkin’s brand of smart devices that can control home electronics and utilities using just a home’s Wi-Fi network. The WeMo mobile app is the virtual hub for all device control and is a key component in using WeMo products. I am developing test scripts using the latest tools available in Xcode 9 and Swift 4.

				<h2>AMAZON ALEXA DEVELOPER<h2>
				<h3>Independent | June 2017-Present</h3>
				<p>
				The Amazon Alexa platform allows developers to build apps in JavaScript, called skills, for the cloud-based Alexa service. I’ve built and released five different Alexa skills, which integrate a number of Amazon Web Service (AWS) and third-party API’s to deliver unique content. While developing skills, I encountered and overcame issues regarding asynchronous programming, API key security, and data persistence between sessions. I have about 35 unique users interact with my skills per week, and am always finding ways to bring new ideas to the platform.

				<h2>DIRECTOR OF MARKETING<h2>
				<h3>UC Riverside ASPB | August 2015-June 2016</h3>
				<p>
				As a Director of Marketing for UCR’s Associated Students Program Board, I led the design and marketing for various small and large scale campus events. I frequently collaborated with different members of my 15-person team to evaluate marketing strategies and to brainstorm eye-catching designs. Since events ranged from small speaking engagements to concerts with over 12,000 in attendance, I had many opportunities to assemble my skills in Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects to generate unique content tailored to each event.

								<h4>GIF GURU</h4>
								<p>
								GIF Guru is an Alexa skill that leverages the Giphy API to search for and deliver GIF images to user’s phones. It uses Amazon S3 to secure sensitive information using at-rest encryption, Amazon DynamoDB to associate phone numbers with Echo devices for data persistence, and Amazon SNS to text resulting GIF’s to users. All API calls were asynchronous and were chained together using promise objects.

								<h4>MY BOXING COACH</h4>
								<p>
								My Boxing Coach is a skill that allows Alexa to voice out boxing commands to users. This skill is great for boxers of all levels to practice when they don’t have the luxury of a class, coach, or partner. The user can tell Alexa pre or mid-interaction how many rounds they would like to do. Each round consists of combinations that increase in difficulty, but no two rounds are the same. My Boxing Coach boasts the highest usage rate of all my skills with over 120 unique users per month. </p>
